# Cryptocurrencies
Accountability Accounting, an investment bank, is interested in offering a new cryptocurrency investment portfolio. The company has asked us to deliver a report that includes current trading cryptocurrencies and a grouped classification system for the cryptocurrencies.

The data needs to be processed to fit the machine learning models. We are going to use unsupervised learning model since we do not know what the data should look like. To group the cryptocurrencies, we will utilize a clustering algorithm. Graphs will be created to help us understand and visualize the data. 

*  Deliverable 1: Preprocessing the Data for PCA
*  Deliverable 2: Reducing Data Dimensions Using PCA
*  Deliverable 3: Clustering Cryptocurrencies Using K-means
*  Deliverable 4: Visualizing Cryptocurrencies Results
